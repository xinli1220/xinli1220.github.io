		<p><i>This soundslide is about a rower of Kansas Crew at the University of Kansas. Kate Marples, a law school student now, has been on the crew for six years. She has won NCRA champions and a lot of other regional regattas with her partner. She is still training for regattas.

Marples is also an assistant coach for the crew. She says she enjoys coaching new members and helping them making differences through their college lives.

Rowing is a demanding sport, which requires tremendous working-out and practicing. Kate gets up at five o’clock every day from Monday to Friday to train others and herself. The desire to win is what drives her everyday, said Marples.

The pictures are of her as a trainee, a coach, and a competent athlete. Pictures are taken in the boat house, on the lake and in Marples’ home last fall.
